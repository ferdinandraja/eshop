<h2> Reflection 1 </h2>
I feel that I have implemented clean code in this project. It is not a new subject to me, but for this tutorial, I force myself to give a more readable name for the variables. For examples variable currentItem to track the item in the loop. 
For Secure code, I don't think I have implemented it. Because of my unfamiliarity with this MVC concept with controller (which is quite complex) I find it difficult to also implement this subject.
I believe that for further steps of this project I need to make my code more readable and more secure.

<h2> Reflection 2 </h2>

1. I felt pretty secured and safe after did the second exercise, which is make testing. It's because finally I finish
my assignment. I also relieved that all my testing went pretty well because I have covered 100% on the class, 66% on the method
and 61% on the line. But it doesn't mean that my code is bug-free. Because sometimes the testing went perfect and sometimes
there's an error.

2. The code should be clean because teh code before is already clean. But I think it's too verbose because
   you already did the same set up before. Therefore it is recommended to use the same class before.
