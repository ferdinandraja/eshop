Reflection 1:
I feel that I have implemented clean code in this project. It is not a new subject to me, but for this tutorial, I force myself to give a more readable name for the variables. For examples variable currentItem to track the item in the loop. 
For Secure code, I don't think I have implemented it. Because of my unfamiliarity with this MVC concept with controller (which is quite complex) I find it difficult to also implement this subject.
I believe that for further steps of this project I need to make my code more readable and more secure.
