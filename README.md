<h1> Module 1</h1>

<h2> Reflection 1 </h2>
I feel that I have implemented clean code in this project. It is not a new subject to me, but for this tutorial, I force myself to give a more readable name for the variables. For examples variable currentItem to track the item in the loop. 
For Secure code, I don't think I have implemented it. Because of my unfamiliarity with this MVC concept with controller (which is quite complex) I find it difficult to also implement this subject.
I believe that for further steps of this project I need to make my code more readable and more secure.

<h2> Reflection 2 </h2>

1. I felt pretty secured and safe after did the second exercise, which is make testing. It's because finally I finish
my assignment. I also relieved that all my testing went pretty well because I have covered 100% on the class, 66% on the method
and 61% on the line. But it doesn't mean that my code is bug-free. Because sometimes the testing went perfect and sometimes
there's an error.

2. The code should be clean because teh code before is already clean. But I think it's too verbose because
   you already did the same set-up before. Therefore, it is recommended to use the same class before.

<h1>Modul 2</h1>
<h2> Reflection 1 </h2>
The most distinct quality issues that I have encounter in this project is many unused import. Therefore, since last week and this week, I immediately delete the unused import.
The other quality issues regarding the code maybe the name of the variable. Sometimes I spend most of my time to think about what kind of variable name that I should use.

<h2> Reflection 2 </h2>
Yes, my project right now has already met the definition of Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment. Since my code has been connected with sonarcloud, OSSF Scorecard and the koyeb has already assigned to deploy automatically, it has met the requirements. So, everytime I push my prohect to GitHub, my project will deploy automatically.

<h1>Modul 3</h1>
<h2> Reflection 1 </h2>
For this exercise, I have use three principles for my code. First, I implemented Liskov Substitution Principle which is a principle where the subclass has the same function as the super class. Therefore, to apply this principle, I separated the CarController with the ProductController, because the CarController should not extend the ProductController because it has a different function.
Secondly, I applied the Dependency Inversion Principle where it depends on the abstract classes and interface instead of concrete classes. I implemented this in the repository where I created a new interface class to be referenced on the CarRepository and services.
Lastly, my code has already implemented the Open-Closed Principle, where software entities such as classes and functions should open for extension. I did not add any modification for this principle because based on my analysis the code from tutorial has already implemented this principle.

<h2> Reflection 2 </h2>
The advantages of SOLID code is it makes the code easy to developed further. For example, because this code has already implemented Open-Closed Principle, it makes it easy to modify this code, just add some extensions.

<h3> Reflection 3</h3>
If the SOLID code principles is not applied, it makes it harder for further development. For example, in my code, if I did not apply the Open-Closed Principle, for further development I need to create most of the class from scratch.
